🎮 Game Overview: Pokémon: PH Server

Features:
✅Interactive Story Start
Players are greeted with a welcome screen and a short introduction to set the tone of the game. They enter their name, which is used throughout the game for a personalized experience.

🔥Starter Pokémon Selection
Choose from 3 iconic Pokémon to begin your journey:
1. Blastoise – A tanky Water-type with powerful hydro cannons
2. Bulbasaur – A balanced Grass/Poison-type ideal for tactical players
3. Charizard – A fierce Fire/Flying-type with strong offense

⚔️Battle System
Face off against a randomly chosen wild Pokémon from a pool of 3 potential enemies:
1. Gengar
2. Froslass
3. Malamar
Each enemy has a unique appearance and randomized health bar that updates dynamically.

🩹Turn-Based Mechanics
Players can take actions each turn using 3 buttons:
1. Attack! – Deal random damage to the enemy (10–30 HP)
2. Use HP! – Restore 20 HP to your Pokémon
3. Retreat – Flee from battle with a fun slang dialogue (“Bolt tayo, ‘di ko trip ‘to!”)

💥Enemy AI
The enemy Pokémon retaliates with its own randomized attack each turn, also dealing 10–30 HP damage. If either side’s HP hits zero, the game ends.

🏁Battle Outcome System
Depending on the result, players are shown a victory or defeat message:

Win: “Let’s gooo! That was too easy.”

Lose: “Dang, that hurt. Gotta bounce back.”

🔁Restart Option
After the battle ends, players can click "Restart the Game" to go back to the intro screen and play again with a new setup.
